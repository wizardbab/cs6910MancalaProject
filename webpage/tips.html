            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>If you are the first player, start from the fourth pit. That way, your last seed will land in your house and you get another turn.</li>
               <li>Try to keep the last pit empty if possible. That way, you can play one seed if the turn before you have played around to the opponent's side.</li>
               <li>Focus on putting stones into your house. That is the easiest way to score points. Do not put too much focus into clearing your side of the board though, as you may not have more seeds on your side.</li>
               <li>Play from your rightmost pit often. You can score easy points when there is only one seed in it, and it will also prevent you from passing seeds over to your opponent's side of the board.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Flight</strong> is a strategy used to prevent opponents from capturing your seeds. When the opponent has one or more empty pits and also has seeds that will threaten those pits, move your seeds directly across from that pit so that you won't get all those seeds captured.</li>
               <li><strong>Threaten</strong> is an aggressive strategy used to force an opponent to either initiate a capture swap or to use flight himself. If he has seeds that are threatening your seeds, you can move seeds to directly threaten his as well.</li>
               <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> is an indirect defensive strategy that involves wrapping your seeds to the opponent's side to make a threatened pit ineligible for capture.</li>
               <li><strong>Starving</strong> is refusing to repopulate the opponent's side of the board by hoarding seeds on your side and forcing the opponent to clear his side early. However, be careful with this strategy as the opponent might be able to capture your hoarded seeds on his way to clearing his board, thus defeating the purpose of hoarding in the first place.</li>
