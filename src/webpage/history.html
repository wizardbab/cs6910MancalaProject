            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
               The name "Mancala" literally means "to move" in Arabic. There isn't any game that explicitly uses the name Mancala to describe the board game.
               Rather, it is a generic word that describes the class of board games that use stones, seeds, beans, or other similar objects played on a board.
               It is said that the game originated somewhere in Africa and soon spread all around the world.
               Numerous archeological surveys have dug up variations of the board game in Israel, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Baltics, and the Far East dating back thousands of years.

            <h2>Variations</h2><br>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Bao</strong> is a popular variant played in Kenya and Zanzibar. It features a 4x8 board with 64 <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="shells"><i>kete</i></a>.
                  Unlike our variation of Mancala, Bao players place six kete in their <i>nyumba</i>, or house, two more in the two pits immediately to the right, and hold the rest.
                  The seeds are then introduced in the first phase of play called the <i>namua</i> phase.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Kalah</strong> is the variant that I am using as the "main" version. It features a 2x6 board and two stores on the ends.
                  Four seeds are placed into each pit for a total of 48 seeds. This variation has been the most popular and commercially available variation in the West.
                  It has been referred to as <i>Warri</i>, <i>Awari</i>, or <i>Oware</i>, although those are slightly different variations played in Western Africa. 
                  Extensive research has been done on this variation of Mancala, and as a result, it has been solved (eg. the first player will always win with perfect play).
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Pallanguzhi</strong> is played in Tamil nadu in Southern India. It features a 2x7 board and 146 seeds. The game is won when one player captures all the stones.
                  Unlike our variation, the player's turn keeps going until he lands in a pit with two empty pits after it. A player also captures a pit if there are six seeds as a result of sowing.
